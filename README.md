##  About Me

I am a **B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence** with a strong interest in **applied machine learning and Python-based systems**.

I focus on building projects that go **beyond notebooks**, emphasizing:
- clean project structure  
- reproducible ML pipelines  
- practical problem solving  
- understanding systems end-to-end  

I enjoy working on **real-world data**, implementing models from scratch, and writing readable, modular code.

🎯 **Long-term goal:** Build scalable, real-world products and grow into a strong AI/ML engineer.
